# Introduction #

Termite Scheme is a variant of Scheme intended for distributed
computing. It offers a simple and powerful concurrency model,
inspired by the Erlang programming language, which is based on a
message-passing model of concurrency.

It runs on top of [Gambit-C](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit), a very nice Scheme system developed by Marc Feeley at Université de Montréal.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

The plan is to add documentation for Termite on this Wiki.
